# USB_MIDI
Not a full implementation of the MIDI over USB library for the Arduino/Teensy, but add-ons to add MIDI time code functionality.
(Example sketch to generate MIDI time code also includes the option to use as stand-alone, i.e. generating and sending the time code without the actual library.)
